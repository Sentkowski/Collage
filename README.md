# Collage
Collage Cut â€“ application that allows users to create photo collages.

This is my **first project** (e.g. hence the vars). It's not perfect, not 100% consistent, but ultimately I believe I learned a lot while working on it. It also shows, when comapred with my newer projects, all the progress I have made.

Thanks to it I familiarized myself with:
* classes, getters & setters,
* handling touch and click events,
* Sass, Haml and jQuery,
* canvas, image and file manipulation,
* EXIF metadata.
